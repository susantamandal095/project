              How does COVID-19 spread between people?

            <mat-card-content>
              We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several
              different ways.

              The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,
              sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller
              aerosols.

              Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each
              other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets
              containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.
              The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend
              longer periods of time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 1
              metre (long-range).
              People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus when
              touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.

              Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky
              and why. Research is also under way to study virus variants that are emerging and why some are more
              transmissible.

              When do infected people transmit the virus?
            </mat-card-title>
            <!-- <mat-card-subtitle>

            <mat-card-content>
              Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to
              other people.

              Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop
              symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop
              severe disease can be infectious for longer.

              While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how
              frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area.

              What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Don’t they both mean

              What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Don’t they both mean

            </mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
              Both terms refer to people who do not have symptoms. The difference is that ‘asymptomatic’ refers to
              people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while ‘pre-symptomatic’ refers to infected people
              who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later.

              Are there certain settings where COVID-19 can spread more easily?
            </mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
              Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time
              increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation,
              are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as
              singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission.

              The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe settings where transmission of the
              COVID-19 virus spreads more easily:

              Crowded places;
              Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;
              Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.

              There are many things you can do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from COVID-19. Know your risks
              to lower risks. Follow these basic precautions:

              Follow local guidance: Check to see what national, regional and local authorities are advising so you have
              the most relevant information for where you are.
              Keep your distance: Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick, since
              people can have the virus without having symptoms.
              Wear a mask: Wear a well-fitting three-layer mask, especially when you can’t physically distance, or if
              you’re indoors. Clean your hands before putting on and taking off a mask.
              Read our Masks and COVID-19 Q&A and watch our videos on how to wear and make masks.
              Avoid crowded places, poorly ventilated, indoor locations and avoid prolonged contact with others. Spend
              more time outdoors than indoors.
              Ventilation is important: Open windows when indoors to increase the amount of outdoor air.
              Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people infected with
              COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants.
              Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you can, carry
              alcohol-based rub with you and use it often.
              Cover your coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing used tissues into a closed bin right
              away. Then wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub.
              Get vaccinated: When it’s your turn, get vaccinated. Follow local guidance and recommendations about
              vaccination.
